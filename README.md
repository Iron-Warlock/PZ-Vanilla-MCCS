# More Starting (Vanilla) Clothing Choices for Project Zomboid

This version is specific for the Small Vanilla PZ servers, with changes in the list discussed with the admin team.

Dev notes:
Professions with a single eyepatch as specific items are set to avoid breakage.
Apparently, without an item, the profession "breaks". Not a perfect solution but it works.

Item names are taken from game source. "veteren" in the Veteran items are TIS typos, changing them breaks the selection screen.
